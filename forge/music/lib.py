"""Composition helpers for snippets.

These functions are pre-injected into the snippet namespace by the executor
(see _FORGE_MUSIC_LIB_NAMES in forge.core.executor). They wrap common
music21 patterns — bar building, voice combination, sequencing, scales,
and repetition — so snippet authors can express compositions in a few
lines without re-deriving the boilerplate each time.

All composition operations return Score (uniform return type hides the
Part/Score asymmetry of music21). `bar` returns Measure because it's a
building block, not a finished artifact.
